<h2>To Pimp a Butterfly</h2>
<p>Rating: 10/10</p>
<details>
    <summary>Album Review</summary>
    <p>To Pimp a Butterfly" is straight-fire, there's no other way. 
        Kendrick Lamar goes all out, dropping a true bomb and lyrical genius that makes you feel right. The beats? Oh man, they're wild rides of jazz, funk, and soul  like nothing else. Kendrick's flow is so smooth it's like he's talking to you through the speakers.And let's talk about the production, top-notch stuff that wraps you in the music. 
        This album isn't just music it's a vibe, a whole a nodding experience in one It makes me think back in time. Solid 10/10, without a doubt, Kendrick is a legend for a reason.</p>

<h2>Goodbye & Good Riddance - Juice WRLD</h2>
<p>Rating: 7/10</p>
<details>
    <summary>Album Review</summary>
    <p>Juice WRLD's album is a solid 7/10, offering a mix of emotional depth and catchy beats. 
        The late rapper's introspective tackles issues of heartbreak, struggle and the dark side of fame, the vocals bring a raw authenticity to the songs and Juice WRLD’s voice stand out creates memorable moments, creating an emotional connection with the listener. 
        But the album sometimes relies heavily on specific sounds, leaving some songs feeling a bit stylized. While there are outstanding moments that showcase Juice WRLD’s genius, there is still room for versatility across the sonic palette. Despite these nuances, the album stands as a testament to Juice WRLD’s impact on the genre and its ability to connect with fans through authenticity and relatability</p>

<h2>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - Kanye West</h2>
<p>Rating: 9/10</p>

<details>
    <summary>Album Review</summary>
    <p>Kanye West's "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" is nothing short of a masterpiece, as it received a well-deserved 9/10. This album is a sonic journey that pushes the boundaries of hip-hop, blending genres with ease. Kanye's production is incredible to say the least. Guest features, from Jay-Z to Bon Iver, hit hard and are extremely well done. Each track feels like a carefully crafted work of art, contributing to a narrative of self-reflection and social critique. The album’s bold and experimental quality sets it apart. It can at times feel chaotic and reach for too much but so is Kanye. "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" is a testament to just how great Kanye West is.</p>

<h2>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill - Lauryn Hill</h2>
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>
<details>
    <summary>Album Review</summary>
    <p>Lauryn Hill's "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" is a solid 8/10, standing as a landmark in the world of hip-hop and R&B. The combo of R&B, soul, and hip-hop elements creates a really well done album. Standout tracks like "Doo Wop” and "Ex-Factor" showcase Hill's ability to blend storytelling with melodies. However, the album's repetitive themes can in some cases get annoying.
