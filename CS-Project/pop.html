                <summary>Album Review</summary>
            <p>To say that Abbey Road is a good influential album would be an offensive understatement. With this record, the Beatles unleashed the formula that would define modern music forever. Some may even argue that this album marked the start of a new era in music. With its catchy and appealing choruses to beautiful instrumentals, there is no doubt in my mind that this album has changed the course of music forever. While many older albums crafted around the same time have become outdated and have begun to sound monotone, The Beatles built an LP that was meant to last forever and has engraved itself into countless listeners.</p>

            <h2>Reputation - Taylor Swift</h2>
            <p>Rating: 2/10</p>
            <Details> <Summary>Album Review</Summary>
            Taylor Swift's "Reputation" disappoints on many levels. The album attempts to showcase a more edgy and rebellious side of Swift, but it feels forced and insincere. The lyrics lack depth, relying on clich√©s and overused themes of heartbreak and revenge. The production, while polished, often drowns out any genuine emotion, leaving the listener with a sense of emptiness.

            <p>Rating: 6/10</p>
            <details> <Summary>Album Review</Summary>
             Lemonade takes some ambitous swings but does not hit all the time and can often look flat. Beyonce is amazing vocally on the album and does a lot of good for the record. Even the production gives the album great focus but the amount of experimental takes on this album is too muich for me. It can feel too fast paced at times and feels unfinished.

            <p>Rating: 8/10</p>
            <details> <summary>Album Review</summary>
       Blonde is a beautiful album that takes Neo Soul to new heights. Frank Ocean's incredible vocals feel complete and really make the album stand out. 
        The conceptual things in the album can feel repetitive but Frank Ocean makes up for it with a consistent effort throughout the album that makes it feel complete. 
        I am feeling a strong 8 on this album. <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3mH6qwIy9crq0I9YQbOuDf?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></details>

            <p>Rating: 5/10</p>
            <details>  <summary>Album Review</summary>
        The album or performance has some enjoyable elements, but it may lack the innovation or impact that would elevate it to a higher rating. The band's signature style and Alex Turner's distinctive vocals might still shine through, but the overall experience might be somewhat mediocre compared to their more outstanding work. This is just my opinion but I feel like its warranted in this landscape of rock music. <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/78bpIziExqiI9qztvNFlQu?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></details>
